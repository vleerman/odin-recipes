        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Dashi is a japanese stock used for many japanese dishes. We will describe 
        the recipe for konbudashi which uses dried kelp and bonito flakes. The stock will
        have a great umami flavor!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ounce dashi kombu (dried kelp)</li>
            <li>1 quart water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup bonito flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the kombu and water in a saucepan, allow it to soak for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove the kombu from the water, cut lenghtwise slits. Return the kombu
                to the water and bring to a boil. When it boils, remove the kombu to prevent
                the stock from becoming bitter</li>
            <li>Stir the bonito flakes into the water, bring back to a boil. Once it does, take the pan 
                off the heat. Allow water to cool. Strain the dashi and you are done!</li>
